# OCCS-Extension-Wizard
OCCS Widget Wizard is a Python’s automation module that allows you to create widget and extension code base structures for your Oracle Commerce Cloud projects. 

Instead of repeating tedious steps to create your Oracle Commerce Cloud’s widget and extension file and folder structures you simply provide with the necessary information needed by your Oracle Commerce Cloud’s backend instance and the module will generate the structure and the basic code you need to start working on your next widget or extension. On top of that, you can also upload it directly to your Oracle Commerce Cloud’s backend instance from the wizard process itself.
